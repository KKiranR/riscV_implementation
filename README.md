## RISCV based MYTH

RISC based MYTH (microprocessor for you in thirty hours) is a workshop which helps us build a RISC-V processor in 5 days.This RISC-V processor is designed with the help of Transaction Level Verilog (TLVerilog) made use in MakerChip IDE platform. In this workshop, we will be working from Day 3 onwards.
### Day3
** Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip**
**Combinational logic in TL- Verilog and Makerchip**
**Basic Logic Gates:**

### Validity
- Addding validity makes it easier to debug.
- It provides a cleaner design.
- Automatic clock gating
